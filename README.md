# Stormpath Ruby SDK

Stormpath is the first easy, secure user management and authentication service for developers.
This is the Ruby SDK to ease integration of its features with any Ruby language based
application.

## Install

```sh
$ gem install stormpath-sdk
```

## Provision Your Stormpath Account

If you have not already done so, register as a developer on
[Stormpath][stormpath] and set up your API credentials and resources:

1. Create a [Stormpath][stormpath] developer account and
   [create your API Keys][create-api-keys] downloading the
   <code>apiKey.properties</code> file into a <code>.stormpath</code>
   folder under your local home directory.

1. Through the [Stormpath Admin UI][stormpath-admin-login], create yourself
   an [Application Resource][concepts]. On the Create New Application
   screen, make sure the "Create a new directory with this application" box
   is checked. This will provision a [Directory Resource][concepts] along
   with your new Application Resource and link the Directory to the
   Application as a [Login Source][concepts]. This will allow users
   associated with that Directory Resource to authenticate and have access
   to that Application Resource.

   It is important to note that although your developer account comes with
   a built-in Application Resource (called "Stormpath") - you will still
   need to provision a separate Application Resource.

1. Take note of the _REST URL_ of the Application you just created. Your
   web application will communicate with the Stormpath API in the context
   of this one Application Resource (operations such as: user-creation,
   authentication, etc.)

## Getting Started

1.  **Require the Stormpath Ruby SDK**

    ```ruby
    require 'stormpath-sdk'
    ```

1.  **Create a client** using the API key properties file

    ```ruby
    client = Stormpath::Client.new api_key_file_location: File.join(ENV['HOME'], '.stormpath', 'apiKey.properties')
    ```

1.  **List all your applications and directories**

    ```ruby
    client.applications.each do |application|
      p "Application: #{application.name}"
    end

    client.directories.each do |directory|
      p "Directory: #{directory.name}"
    end
    ```

1.  **Get access to the specific application and directory** using the
    URLs you acquired above.

    ```ruby
    application = client.applications.get(application_url)

    directory = client.directories.get(directory_url)
    ```

1.  **Create an account for a user** on the directory.

    ```ruby
    account = directory.accounts.create(
      given_name: 'John',
      surname: 'Smith',
      email: 'john.smith@example.com',
      username: 'johnsmith',
      password: '4P@$$w0rd!'
    )
    ```

1.  **Update an account**

    ```ruby
    account.given_name = 'Johnathan'
    account.middle_name = 'A.'
    account.save
    ```

1.  **Authenticate the Account** for use with an application:

    ```ruby
    auth_request =
      Stormpath::Authentication::UsernamePasswordRequest.new 'johnsmith', '4P@$$w0rd!'

    begin
      auth_result = application.authenticate_account auth_request
      account = auth_result.account
    rescue Stormpath::Error => e
      #If credentials are invalid or account doesn't exist
    end
    ```

1.  **Send a password reset request**

    ```ruby
    application.send_password_reset_email 'john.smith@example.com'
    ```

1.  **Create a group** in a directory

    ```ruby
    directory.groups.create(name: 'Admins')
    ```

1.  **Add the account to the group**

    ```ruby
    group.add_account account
    ```

1. **Check for account inclusion in group** by reloading the account

    ```ruby
    account = client.accounts.get(account.href)
    is_admin = account.groups.any? { |group| group.name == 'Admins' }
    ```

## Common Uses

### Creating a client

All Stormpath features are accessed through a
<code>Stormpath::Client</code> instance, or a resource
created from one. A client needs an API key (made up of an _id_ and a
_secret_) from your Stormpath developer account to manage resources
on that account. That API key can be specified any number of ways
in the hash of values passed on Client initialization:

* The location of API key properties file:

  ```ruby
  client = Stormpath::Client.new
    api_key_file_location: '/some/path/to/apiKey.properties'
  ```

  You can even identify the names of the properties to use as the API
  key id and secret. For example, suppose your properties was:

  ```
  foo=APIKEYID
  bar=APIKEYSECRET
  ```

  You could load it with the following:

  ```ruby
  client = Stormpath::Client.new
    api_key_file_location: '/some/path/to/apiKey.properties',
    api_key_id_property_name: 'foo',
    api_key_secret_property_name: 'bar'
  ```

* Passing in a Stormpath::APIKey instance:

  ```ruby
  api_key = Stormpath::ApiKey.new api_id, api_secret
  client = Stormpath::Client.new api_key: api_key
  ```

* By explicitly setting the API key id and secret:

  ```ruby
  client = Stormpath::Client.new
    api_key: { id: api_id, secret: api_secret }
  ```

* By passing a composite application url to `Application.load`:

  ```ruby
  composite_url = "http://#{api_key_id}:#{api_key_secret}@api.stormpath.com/v1/applications/#{application_id}"

  application = Stormpath::Resource::Application.load composite_url
  client = application.client
  ```

To change the base_url for the Enterprise product, pass the following option to `Stormpath::Client.new()` :

  ```ruby
  client = Stormpath::Client.new(
    api_key_file_location: '/some/path/to/apiKey.properties',
    base_url: 'https://enterprise.stormpath.io/v1'
  )
  ```

* By passing a composite application url to `Application.load`:

  ```ruby
  composite_url = "http://#{api_key_id}:#{api_key_secret}@api.stormpath.com/v1/applications/#{application_id}"

  application = Stormpath::Resource::Application.load composite_url
  client = application.client
  ```


### Accessing Resources

Most of the work you do with Stormpath is done through the applications
and directories you have registered. You use the client to access them
with their REST URL:

```ruby
application = client.applications.get(application_url)

directory = client.directories.get(directory_url)
```

The <code>applications</code> and <code>directories</code> property on a
client instance are also <code>Enumerable</code> allowing you to iterate
and scan for resources via that interface.

Additional resources are <code>accounts</code>, <code>groups</code>,
<code>group_membership</code>, and the single reference to your
<code>tenant</code>.

### Creating Resources

Applications and directories can be created directly off the client.

```ruby
application = client.applications.create(name: 'foo', description: 'bar')

directory = client.directories.create(name: 'foo', description: 'bar')
```

### Collections
#### Search

Resource collections can be searched by a general query string or by attribute.

Passing a string to the search method will filter by any attribute on the collection:

```ruby
client.applications.search 'foo'
```

To search a specific attribute or attributes, pass a hash:

```ruby
client.applications.search name: 'foo', description: 'bar'
```

#### Pagination

Collections can be paginated using chainable Arel-like methods. <code>offset</code> is the zero-based starting index in the entire collection of the first item to return. Default is 0. <code>limit</code> is the maximum number of collection items to return for a single request. Minimum value is 1. Maximum value is 100. Default is 25.

```ruby
client.applications.offset(10).limit(100).each do |application|
  # do something
end
```

#### Order

Collections can be ordered. In the following example, a paginated collection is ordered.

```ruby
client.applications.offset(10).limit(100).order('name asc,description desc')
```

#### Entity Expansion

A resource's children can be eager loaded by passing the entity expansion object as the second argument to a call to <code>get</code>.

```ruby
expansion = Stormpath::Resource::Expansion.new 'groups', 'group_memberships'
client.accounts.get(account.href, expansion)
```

<code>limit</code> and <code>offset</code> can be specified for each child resource by calling <code>add_property</code>.

```ruby
expansion = Stormpath::Resource::Expansion.new
expansion.add_property 'groups', offset: 5, limit: 10

client.accounts.get(account.href, expansion)
```

### ID Site

ID Site is a set of hosted and pre-built user interface screens that easily add authentication to your application. ID Site can be accessed via your own custom domain like id.mydomain.com and shared across multiple applications to create centralized authentication if needed. To use ID Site an url needs to be generated which contains JWT token as a parameter.

#### ID Site Login

In order to use ID Site an url needs to be generated. You also need to redirect to the generated url. You can call create_id_site_url which is on application object. For example if you are using sinatra the code would look something like this:

```ruby
get ‘login’ do
  redirect application.create_id_site_url callback_uri: “#{callback_uri}”
end
```

The application will be an instance of your application. callback_uri is a url with which you want to handle the ID Site information, this url also needs to be set in the Stormpath’s dashboard on [ID Site settings page](https://api.stormpath.com/ui2/index.html#/id-site) as Authorized Redirect URLs.

##### Using ID Site for [multitenancy][id-site-multitenancy]

When a user wants to login to your application, you may want to specify an organization for the user to login to. Stormpath ID Site is configurable to support multitenancy with Organization resources

```ruby
application.create_id_site_url({
  callback_uri: 'https://trooperapp.com/callback',
  organization_name_key: 'stormtrooper',
  show_organization_field: true
});
```

##### Using Subdomains

In some cases, you may want to show the organization that the user is logging into as a subdomain instead of an form field. To configure this, you need to use a [wildcard certificate][wildcard-certificate] when setting up your [custom domain with ID Site][custom-domain-with-id-site]. Otherwise, the Stormpath infrastructure will cause browser SSL errors.

Once a wildcard certificate is configured on your domain, you can tell ID Site to use a subdomain to represent the organization:

```ruby
application.create_id_site_url({
  callback_uri: 'https://trooperapp.com/callback',
  organization_name_key: 'stormtrooper',
  use_subdomain: true
});
```

##### Specifying the Organization

In the case where you are using a subdomain to designate the organization, you can tell ID Site which organization the user is logging into to.

```ruby
application.create_id_site_url({
  callback_uri: 'https://trooperapp.com/callback',
  organization_name_key: 'stormtrooper',
  show_organization_field: true
})
```

#### Handle ID Site Callback

For any request you make for ID Site, you need to specify a callback uri. To parse the information from the servers response and to decode the data from the JWT token you need to call the handle_id_site_callback method and pass the Request URI.

For example in your sinatra app this would look something like this:

```ruby
app.get ‘/callback' do
  user_data = application.handle_id_site_callback(request.url)
end
```

> NOTE:
> A JWT Response Token can only be used once. This is to prevent replay attacks. It will also only be valid for a total of 60 seconds. After which time, You will need to restart the workflow you were in.

#### Other ID Site Options

There are a few other methods that you will need to concern yourself with when using ID Site. Logging out a User, Registering a User, and a User who has forgotten their password. These methods will use the same information from the login method but a few more items will need to be passed into the array. For example if you have a sinatra application.

##### Logging Out a User
```ruby
app.get ‘/logout' do
  user_data = application.handle_id_site_callback(request.url)
  redirect application.create_id_site_url callback_uri: “#{callback_uri}”, logout: true
end
```

##### Registering a User
```ruby
app.get ‘/register' do
  user_data = application.handle_id_site_callback(request.url)
  redirect application.create_id_site_url callback_uri: “#{callback_uri}”, path: ‘/#/register'
end
```

##### Forgot Link
```ruby
app.get ‘/forgot' do
  user_data = application.handle_id_site_callback(request.url)
  redirect application.create_id_site_url callback_uri: “#{callback_uri}”, path: ‘/#/forgot'
end
```

Again, with all these methods, You will want your application to link to an internal page where the JWT is created at that time. Without doing this, a user will only have 60 seconds to click on the link before the JWT expires.

> NOTE:
> A JWT will expire after 60 seconds of creation.

#### Fetch Stormpath Access Token with username and password
Stormpath can generate a brand new Access Token using the password grant type: User's credentials.

To fetch the oauth token use the following snippet
```ruby
grant_request = Stormpath::Oauth::PasswordGrantRequest.new(email, password)
response = application.authenticate_oauth(grant_request)
```

Just like with logging-in a user, it is possible to generate a token against a particular Application’s Account Store or Organization. To do so, specify the Account Store’s href or Organization’s nameKey as a parameter in the request:

```ruby
grant_request = Stormpath::Oauth::PasswordGrantRequest.new(email, password, organization_name_key: 'my-stormpath-organization')
response = application.authenticate_oauth(grant_request)
```

#### Exchange ID Site token for a Stormpath Access Token
After the user has been authenticated via ID Site, a developer may want to control their authorization with an OAuth 2.0 Token.
This is done by passing the JWT similar to the way we passed the user’s credentials as described in [Generating an OAuth 2.0 Access Token][generate-oauth-access-token].
The difference is that instead of using the password grant type and passing credentials, we will use the id_site_token type and pass the JWT we got from the ID Site
more info [here][exchange-id-site-token].

To exchange ID Site token for the oauth token use the following snippet
```ruby
grant_request = Stormpath::Oauth::IdSiteGrantRequest.new jwt_token
response = application.authenticate_oauth grant_request
```

### Exchange Client Credentials for a Stormpath Access Token

As a developer, I want to authenticate API Keys directly against my application endpoint, so that I can have Stormpath generate an application token that I can use for a session.

Create an API Key for an account:

```ruby
account_api_key = account.api_keys.create({})
```

Then create an client credentials request and get a authentication result:

```ruby
client_credentials_grant_request = Stormpath::Oauth::ClientCredentialsGrantRequest.new(
  account_api_key.id,
  account_api_key.secret
)

authentication_result = application.authenticate_oauth(client_credentials_grant_request)

puts authentication_result.access_token
puts authentication_result.refresh_token
```

### Exchange ID site token for a Stormpath Access Token

As a developer, I want to authenticate the user on ID Site but get an access token that I can store on the client to use to access my API.
The oauth token endpoint will validate that:
* the JWT is not tampered
* has not expired
* the account is still associated with the application and will return an access token
* the status claim is either AUTHENTICATED or REGISTERED

If you want to create a stormpath grant request with status <code>authenticated</code> you need to pass the account, application and api key id:

```ruby
stormpath_grant_request = Stormpath::Oauth::StormpathGrantRequest.new(
  account,
  application,
  api_key_id
)
```

If you have the status attribute set to <code>registered</code> then create the request like so:

```ruby
stormpath_grant_request = Stormpath::Oauth::StormpathGrantRequest.new(
  account,
  application,
  api_key_id,
  :registered
)
```

And lastly authenticate with the created request instance:

```ruby
authentication_result = application.authenticate_oauth(stormpath_grant_request)

puts authentication_result.access_token
puts authentication_result.refresh_token
```

### Registering Accounts

Accounts are created on a directory instance. They can be created in two
ways:

* With the <code>create_account</code> method:

  ```ruby
  account = directory.create_account({
    given_name: 'John',
    surname: 'Smith',
    email: 'john.smith@example.com',
    username: 'johnsmith',
    password: '4P@$$w0rd!'
  })
  ```

  This metod can take an additional flag to indicate if the account
  can skip any registration workflow configured on the directory.

  ```ruby
  ## Will skip workflow, if any
  account = directory.create_account account_props, false
  ```

* Creating it directly on the <code>accounts</code> collection property
  on the directory:

  ```ruby
  account = directory.accounts.create(
    given_name: 'John',
    surname: 'Smith',
    email: 'john.smith@example.com',
    username: 'johnsmith',
    password: '4P@$$w0rd!'
  )
  ```

Both these methods can take either a <code>Hash</code> of the account
properties, or a <code>Stormpath::Account</code>.

If the directory has been configured with an email verification workflow
and a non-Stormpath URL, you have to pass the verification token sent to
the URL in a <code>sptoken</code> query parameter back to Stormpath to
complete the workflow. This is done through the
<code>verify_email_token</code> on the <code>accounts</code> collection.

For example, suppose you have a Sinatra application
that is handling the email verification at the path
<code>/users/verify</code>. You could use the following code:

```ruby
get '/users/verify' do
  token = params[:sptoken]
  account = client.accounts.verify_email_token token
  #proceed to update session, display account, etc
end
```

#### Create an Account with an Existing Password Hash

If you are moving from an existing user repository to Stormpath, you may have existing password hashes that you want to reuse to provide a seamless upgrade path for your end users.
More info about this feature can be found [here][mcf-hash-password-doc]

Example of creating an account with existing SHA-512 password hash. For details on other hashing algorithms check the [documentation][stormpath-hash-algorithm]

```ruby
directory.accounts.create({
  username: "jlucpicard",
  email: "captain@enterprise.com",
  given_name: "Jean-Luc",
  surname: "Picard",
  password: "$stormpath2$SHA-512$1$ZFhBRmpFSnEwVEx2ekhKS0JTMDJBNTNmcg==$Q+sGFg9e+pe9QsUdfnbJUMDtrQNf27ezTnnGllBVkQpMRc9bqH6WkyE3y0svD/7cBk8uJW9Wb3dolWwDtDLFjg=="
}, password_format: 'mcf')
```

### Authentication

Authentication is accomplished by passing a username or an email and a
password to <code>authenticate_account</code> of an application we've
registered on Stormpath. This will either return a
<code>Stormpath::Authentication::AuthenticationResult</code> instance if
the credentials are valid, or raise a <code>Stormpath::Error</code>
otherwise. In the former case, you can get the <code>account</code>
associated with the credentials.

```ruby
auth_request =
  Stormpath::Authentication::UsernamePasswordRequest.new 'johnsmith', '4P@$$w0rd!'

begin
  auth_result = application.authenticate_account auth_request
  account = auth_result.account
rescue Stormpath::Error => e
  #If credentials are invalid or account doesn't exist
end
```

The `UsernamePasswordRequest` can take an optional link to the application’s accountStore (directory or group) or the Organization nameKey. Specifying this attribute can speed up logins if you know exactly which of the application’s assigned account stores contains the account: Stormpath will not have to iterate over the assigned account stores to find the account to authenticate it. This can speed up logins significantly if you have many account stores (> 15) assigned to the application.

The `UsernamePasswordRequest` can receive the AccountStore in three ways.

Passing the organization, directory or group instance:

```ruby
auth_request =
  Stormpath::Authentication::UsernamePasswordRequest.new 'johnsmith', '4P@$$w0rd!', account_store: organization
```

Passing the organization, directory or group href:

```ruby
auth_request =
  Stormpath::Authentication::UsernamePasswordRequest.new 'johnsmith', '4P@$$w0rd!', account_store: { href: organization.href }
```

Passing the organization name_key:

```ruby
auth_request =
  Stormpath::Authentication::UsernamePasswordRequest.new 'johnsmith', '4P@$$w0rd!', account_store: { name_key: organization.name_key }
```

### Authentication Against a SAML Directory

SAML is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between security domains.
Stormpath enables you to allow customers to log-in by authenticating with an external SAML Identity Provider.

#### Stormpath as a Service Provider

The specific use case that Stormpath supports is user-initiated single sign-on. In this scenario, a user requests
a protected resource (e.g. your application). Your application, with the help of Stormpath, then confirms the users
identity in order to determine whether they are able to access the resource. In SAML terminology, the user is the User
Agent, your application (along with Stormpath) is the Service Provider, and the third-party SAML authentication site
is the Identity Provider or IdP.

The broad strokes of the process are as follows:

* User Agent requests access from Service Provider
* Service Provider responds with redirect to Identity Provider
* Identity Provider authenticates the user
* Identity provider redirects user back to Service Provider along with SAML assertions.
* Service Provider receives SAML assertions and either creates or retrieves Account information

#### Configuring Stormpath as a Service Provider

Configuration is stored in the Directory's Provider resource. Here we will explain to you the steps that are required to configure Stormpath as a SAML Service
Provider.

#### Step 1: Gather IDP Data

You will need the following information from your IdP:

- **SSO Login URL** - The URL at the IdP to which SAML authentication requests should be sent. This is often called an "SSO URL", "Login URL" or "Sign-in URL".
- **SSO Logout URL** - The URL at the IdP to which SAML logout requests should be sent. This is often called a "Logout URL", "Global Logout URL" or "Single Logout URL".
- **Signing Cert** - The IdP will digitally sign auth assertions and Stormpath will need to validate the signature. This will usually be in .pem or .crt format, but Stormpath requires the text value.
- **Signing Algorithm** - You will need the name of the signing algorithm that your IdP uses. It will be either "RSA-SHA256" or "RSA-SHA1".

#### Step 2: Configure Your SAML Directory

Input the data you gathered in Step 1 above into your Directory's Provider resource, and then pass that along as part of the Directory creation HTTP POST:

```ruby
provider = "saml"
request = Stormpath::Provider::AccountRequest.new(provider, :access_token, access_token)
application.get_provider_account(request)

client.directories.create(
  name: "infinum_directory",
  description: "random description",
  provider: {
    provider_id: "saml"
  }
)
```

to get the data about the provider just type
```ruby
directory.provider
```

provider method returns instance of SamlProvider and you can access the following data

```ruby
dir_provider = directory.provider

dir_provider.provider_id
dir_provider.sso_login_url
dir_provider.sso_logout_url
dir_provider.encoded_x509_signing_cert
dir_provider.request_signature_algorithm
dir_provider.service_provider_metadata
dir_provider.attribute_statement_mapping_rules
dir_provider.created_at
dir_provider.modified_at
```

##### Retrieve Your Service Provider Metadata

Next you will have to configure your Stormpath-powered application as a Service Provider in your Identity Provider. This means that you will need to retrieve the correct metadata from Stormpath.

In order to retrieve the required values, start by sending a GET to the Directory's Provider:

```ruby
directory.service_provider_metadata
```

service_provider_metadata method returns instance of SamlServiceProviderMetadata and you can access the following values

```ruby
dir_provider_metadata = directory.service_provider_metadata

dir_provider_metadata.href
dir_provider_metadata.entity_id
dir_provider_metadata.x509_signing_cert
dir_provider_metadata.assertion_consumer_service_post_endpoint
dir_provider_metadata.created_at
dir_provider_metadata.modified_at
```

From this metadata, you will need two values:

- **Assertion Consumer Service URL**: This is the location the IdP will send its response to.
- **X509 Signing Certificate**: The certificate that is used to sign the requests sent to the IdP. If you retrieve XML, the certificate will be embedded. If you retrieve JSON, you'll have to follow a further /x509certificates link to retrieve it.

You will also need two other values, which will always be the same:

- **SAML Request Binding**: Set to HTTP-Redirect.
- **SAML Response Binding**: Set to HTTP-Post.

#### Step 4: Configure Your Service Provider in Your Identity Provider

Log-in to your Identity Provider (Salesforce, OneLogin, etc) and enter the information you retrieved in
the previous step into the relevant application configuration fields. The specific steps to follow here
will depend entirely on what Identity Provider you use, and for more information you should consult your
Identity Provider's SAML documentation.

#### Step 5: Configure Your Application

The Stormpath `Application` Resource has two parts that are relevant to SAML:

- an ``authorizedCallbackUri`` Array that defines the authorized URIs that the IdP can return your user to. These should be URIs that you host yourself.
- an embedded ``samlPolicy`` object that contains information about the SAML flow configuration and endpoints.

```ruby
application.authorized_callback_uris = ["https://myapplication.com/whatever/callback", "https://myapplication.com/whatever/callback2"]
application.save
```

#### Step 6: Add the SAML Directory as an Account Store

The next step is to map the new Directory to your Application with an Account Store Mapping.

##### Step 7: Configure SAML Assertion Mapping

The Identity Provider's SAML response contains assertions about the user's identity, which Stormpath can use to create and populate a new Account resource.

```xml
  <saml:AttributeStatement>
    <saml:Attribute Name="uid" NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:basic">
      <saml:AttributeValue xsi:type="xs:string">test</saml:AttributeValue>
    </saml:Attribute>
    <saml:Attribute Name="mail" NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:basic">
      <saml:AttributeValue xsi:type="xs:string">jane@example.com</saml:AttributeValue>
    </saml:Attribute>
      <saml:Attribute Name="location" NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:basic">
      <saml:AttributeValue xsi:type="xs:string">Tampa, FL</saml:AttributeValue>
    </saml:Attribute>
  </saml:AttributeStatement>

```
The Attribute Assertions (`<saml:AttributeStatement>`) are brought into Stormpath and become Account and customData attributes.

SAML Assertion mapping is defined in an **attributeStatementMappingRules** object found inside the Directory's Provider object, or directly: `/v1/attributeStatementMappingRules/$RULES_ID`.

##### Mapping Rules
The rules have three different components:

- **name**: The SAML Attribute name
- **name_format**: The name format for this SAML Attribute, expressed as a Uniform Resource Name (URN).
- **account_attributes**: This is an array of Stormpath Account or customData (`customData.$KEY_NAME`) attributes that will map to this SAML Attribute.

In order to create the mapping rules, we simply send the following:

```ruby
rule = {
  name: 'uid',
  account_attributes: ['username']
}

dir.attribute_statement_mapping_rules.items = [rule]
dir.attribute_statement_mapping_rules.save
```

### Password Reset

A password reset workflow, if configured on the directory the account is
registered on, can be kicked off with the
<code>send_password_reset_email</code> method on an application:

```ruby
application.send_password_reset_email 'john.smith@example.com'
```

The method also takes an optional hash with key <code>account_store</code> which will restrict the account search to the account store with that value.

```ruby
application.send_password_reset_email 'john.smith@example.com', account_store: organization
```

If the workflow has been configured to verify through a non-Stormpath
URL, you can verify the token sent in the query parameter
<code>sptoken</code> with the <code>verify_password_reset_token</code>
method on the application.

For example, suppose you have a Sinatra application that is verifying
the tokens. You use the following to carry it out:

```ruby
get '/users/verify' do
  token = params[:sptoken]
  account = application.verify_password_reset_token token
  #proceed to update session, display account, etc
end
```

With the account acquired you can then update the password:

```ruby
  account.password = new_password
  account.save
```

_NOTE :_ Confirming a new password is left up to the web application
code calling the Stormpath SDK. The SDK does not require confirmation.

### Social Providers

To access or create an account in an already created social Directory (facebook, google, github, linkedin),
it is required to gather Authorization Code on behalf of the user. This requires leveraging Oauth 2.0
protocol and the user's consent for your applications permissions. Once you have the access_token you can
access the account via get_provider_account method.

```ruby
provider = ‘facebook’ # can also be google, github, linkedin
request = Stormpath::Provider::AccountRequest.new(provider, :access_token, access_token)
application.get_provider_account(request)
```

### ACL through Groups

Memberships of accounts in certain groups can be used as an
authorization mechanism. As the <code>groups</code> collection property
on an account instance is <code>Enumerable</code>, you can use any of
that module's methods to determine if an account belongs to a specific
group:

```ruby
account.groups.any? {|group| group.name == 'administrators'}
```

You can create groups and assign them to accounts using the Stormpath
web console, or programmatically. Groups are created on directories:

```ruby
group = directory.groups.create(name: 'administrators')
```

Group membership can be created by:

* Explicitly creating a group membership resource with your client:

  ```ruby
  group_membership = client.group_memberships.create(group: group, account: account)
  ```

* Using the <code>add_group</code> method on the account instance:

  ```ruby
  account.add_group group
  ```

* Using the <code>add_account</code> method on the group instance:

  ```ruby
  group.add_account account
  ```

You will need to reload the account or group resource after these
operations to ensure they've picked up the changes.

### Working with Organizations

An `Organization` is a top-level container for Account Stores. You can think of an Organization as a tenant for your multi-tenant application. This is different than your Stormpath Tenant, which represents your tenant in the Stormpath system. Organizations are powerful because you can group together account stores that represent a tenant.

* Locate an organization

  ```ruby
    client.organizations.search(name: 'Finance Organization')
  ```

* Create an organization

  ```ruby
    client.organizations.create(name: 'Finance Organization', name_key: 'finance-organization')
  ```

* Adding an account store to an organization

  ```ruby
    client.organization_account_store_mappings.create(
      account_store: { href: directory_or_group.href },
      organization:  { href: organization.href }
    )
  ```

* Adding an Organization to an Application as an Account Store

  ```ruby
    client.account_store_mappings.create(application: application, account_store: organization)
  ```


### Add Custom Data to Accounts or Groups

Account and Group resources have predefined fields that are useful to many applications, but you are likely to have your own custom data that you need to associate with an account or group as well.

For this reason, both the account and group resources support a linked custom_data resource that you can use for your own needs.

*Set Custom Data*
```ruby
account =  Stormpath::Resource::Account.new({ email: "test@example.com", given_name: 'Ruby SDK', password: 'P@$$w0rd', surname: 'SDK',})

account.custom_data["rank"] = "Captain"
account.custom_data["birth_date"] = "2305-07-13"
account.custom_data["birth_place"] = "La Barre, France"

 directory.create_account account
```

Notice how we did not call account.custom_data.save - creating the account (or updating it later via save) will automatically persist the account's customData resource. The account 'knows' that the custom data resource has been changed and it will propogate those changes automatically when you persist the account.

Groups work the same way - you can save a group and it's custom data resource will be saved as well.

*Delete a specific Custom Data field*
```ruby
account.custom_data["birth_date"] #=> "2305-07-13"
account.custom_data.delete("birth_date")
account.custom_data.save
```

*Delete all Custom Data*
```ruby
account.custom_data.delete
```

## Testing

### Setup

The functional tests of the SDK run against a Stormpath tenant. In that
account they automatically create and destroy resources.

The following environment variables need to be set:

* <code>STORMPATH_CLIENT_APIKEY_ID</code> - The <code>id</code> from
  your Stormpath API key.
* <code>STORMPATH_CLIENT_APIKEY_SECRET</code> - The
  <code>secret</code> from your Stormpath API key.

### Running

Once properly configured, start the redis server with <code>redis-server</code> and the tests can be run as the default
<code>Rake</code> task:

```sh
$ rake
```

Or by specifying the <code>spec</code> task:

```sh
$ rake spec
```

Or through <code>rspec</code>
